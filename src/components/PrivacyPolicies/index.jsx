          <p className="policiesSection_contentText">
            You would be violating this term of service if you misuse your
            username, by misuse of username, we include but not limiting the
            scope to; selling of username and solicitation. You would not be

            <br />
            We also frown at username squatting. If you create many accounts,
            create an account (different from your identity) to prevent the
            legitimate legal personality from using the account, create an
            account so as to sell, create an account for the third party and
            copying third party content to maintain such an account, you might
            be held liable for username squatting. If an account is inactive for
            a long period of time, we might deactivate such an account.

            We do not accommodate impersonation on our platform, impersonation
            in this respect goes beyond misrepresenting to be another person, it
            would be held to be impersonation if you misrepresent to be an
            organization or a group and your intent is to confuse or mislead
            other members of our online community to believe that you are the
            original legal personality.
