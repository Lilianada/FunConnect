                <h4 className='termsSection_contentSubtitle'>2.1 Username Misuse</h4>
                <p className="termsSection_contentText">
                    You would be violating this term of service if you misuse your username, by misuse of username, we include but not limiting the scope to; selling of username and solicitation. You would not be permitted to sell or buy a username on Fun Connect.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We also frown at username squatting. If you create many accounts, create an account (different from your identity) to prevent the legitimate legal personality from using the account, create an account so as to sell, create an account for the third party and copying third party content to maintain such an account, you might be held liable for username squatting. If an account is inactive for a long period of time, we might deactivate such an account.
